# Prodigy-Intern-T2-Stopwatch-web-Application
This Stopwatch Web Application was developed during my internship at Prodigy Infotech using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application features a user-friendly interface that allows users to start, stop, and reset the timer. It also includes lap functionality for tracking multiple time intervals within the same session.
